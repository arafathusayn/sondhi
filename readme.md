## Sondhi

Sondhi is a collection of implementations for the following concepts:

- [Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing) (offline [CLI](./cli/) and online [app](./web/static-web-app/))
- Decentralized Wall-clock Time, based on [multi-blockchains](./time-lock/nest.js/src/time/time.utils.ts)
- [Federated Time-Lock](./time-lock/) (runtime and database)
- Live Sharing of Secrets
- [Passwords for joint-accounts](./web/browser-extensions/)

### Project Goals:

- Digital Asset Inheritence without central authority
- Automatic secret-sharing during one's permanent unavailability
- Building decentralized and federated systems for secret-sharing
- Long-term support for the time-lock data storage
- Preventing the collection of user data using encryption and anonimity
- Converting centralized systems of data-sharing into decentralized systems

### Technologies Used:
- Web Assembly & TypeScript
- Web Cryptography API
- Browser, Deno & Node.js runtimes
- React.js, Next.js, Nest.js & Serverless
- Blockchain JSON-RPC
